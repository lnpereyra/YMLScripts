# YMLScripts

YMLScripts is a tool written in Python, this tool take YML files and using regex makes correction on the formatting of the current file.
In my current job we have a task regarding the correction of several YML files..
Before I developed this tool the task was made manually and take a lot of time, now we can correct a lot of files with just a few clicks.

This tool is still on development because I want to apply to several file formats.

Now Select the folder that contains your YML file that need to be fixed.

Finished!
